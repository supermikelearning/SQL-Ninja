SQL developers won't just write some AD-HOC queries. 

They need to be invloved in the full development circle, from data collection to final reports to the clients.

My years of expereince tells me one thing. Spend as much time as you need to to get the source data right in the beginning! This is the KEY!

For example, when I was developing a payroll calculation system for a call center, I need to collect raw data from system tables of a call center specific system, process the raw to make it not that messy. :) Then do the calulation based on business rules. If the source data is not good and you believe you can make things right at this stage, you are wrong. When there is combination of complicated calcuations and business rules, you will find there are always problems and fixing problems at this point is brain killing and time consuming.

So SQL developers should spend as much time as you need to get source data as clean as possible in the beginning.

If you find a problem in the middle of development, first thing you should do is go back to the source data preparation modules to see what you can do. Don't just try fixes after fixes in the middle modules. Even youself won't remember what and why you did later on, not mention future maintanence for other developers. Moreover, you will never fix all problems if the source data is messy. Believe me.
