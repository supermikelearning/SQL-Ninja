Every SQL developer knows how to use SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE....So what are the biggest difference between newbies and seasoned SQL devlopers? Here they are:

1. Use of Cursor: Cursors might be useful when there are few records. Cursors can take forever to run if the size of data is large. However, cursors are normally the first choice for new SQL developers when they deal with problems with complicated logics. It's easy to understand, you create a loop, read each record and as many fields as you want to, then if...then based on the info. It's easy and any problem can be solved in this way. But it is so SLOW! In my opinion, cursors shouldn'be used in production unless you know the size of data will be small for sure.
